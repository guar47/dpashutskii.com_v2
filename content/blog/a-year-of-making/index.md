I've been working in the IT industry for almost 10 years and for the last 3 years as a web developer. It's been a great time and I'm super happy about my career path but I've decided that it is the time for a new challenge!

Digital entrepreneurs were a huge inspiration for me and it made me think that I want to try myself in this area.

To be honest I know very little about the business side of things. I am a regular programmer. Most of the time I learn about things related to the IT world or somethings around.

That's why it is going to be a great challenge for me. I have the skills to implement the ideas but I don't know how to validate, market, and sell the products. I am planning to learn on the way and achieve as much as possible for the next 12 months.

## Perfect conditions

Right now it's a perfect time for me to start:

- I am finishing and defending my Bachelor's degree in October.
- My current contract with my employer ends on October 14th. I am not going to extend it.
- COVID-19 is still here so I don't travel much.
- I "stuck" in Bali which is cheap so I don't spend much money on living.

I decided to dive into the entrepreneur's world for the whole year until November 2021. Or until I realize it's not for me ðŸ˜ƒ

## Challenge goals

The main goal is pretty simple: **make something profitable**.

Small goal is to reach [ramen profitability](http://www.paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html) which is about â‚¬1000-1500 MRR for me.

The big goal is to make it profitable enough to exceed the developer's salary (Around â‚¬80-90k ARR). It is a huge load of money so I don't have many expectations about this. But it's great to have a big goal.

I am planning to make all process public using the [Makerlog community,](https://getmakerlog.com/@dpashutskii) posts in this blog, and [my Twitter.](https://twitter.com/guar47) I will be as open as I could and I want to make my products transparent as well. At least with open revenue and statistics following the [open startup movement](https://openstartup.dev/).

I understand all the risks and if I can't achieve anything and don't earn even a few bucks I will be fine. The experience and the learnings will still be valuable.

I don't have a problems to get back being software engineer.

## 12xStartup

After I've decided to make this happen I've got a message from a friend from the blogging community. She wanted to create a group of people making the startups every month for 12 months in total. The inspiration comes from the [Piter Levels challenge](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/) back in 2014 and we all know where he is now :)

It was a perfect opportunity for me to stay accountable and get a small community to share all the bumps on the road. So I agreed to take part in it.

Now me and 3 awesome people are doing this. You can follow our journey in here: [https://12xstartup.com/](https://12xstartup.com/).

In theory we will ship 48 startups by the end of 2021. Of course it could be less or more, it doesn't matter that much.
