This is my first post on my new old blog. Hi ‚úåÔ∏è

I decided to simplify my blog and move from [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) and just use simple Markdown to store all the posts. Contentful is great, but I like the approach of reducing third time applications and it's a bit harder to use blog locally. Recently I deleted a couple of posts from Contentful because I accidentally used starter setup command which have default content and could rewrite your posts.

For this blog I just took the simplest [gatsby-blog-starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). Yeah, my blog is looks like all default blogs right now üòÉBut I have plans for tweaking and personalising it.

I used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment (the guys are the best!), added my favourite [styled-components](https://styled-components.com), a few Gatsby plugins and that's it. The blog is done! It's amazing how simple now to start a new blog and how powerful the instruments (React + Gatsby) to customise everything in the future!

Looking forward to post more content this year!
